# feature-mapping-tutorial

This repository contains code from the paper "Mapping brain function in adults and young children during naturalistic viewing with high-density diffuse optical tomography". In particular, this repository contains a tutorial for feature mapping of animated movie clips. This tutorial includes a univariate (correlation) approach to feature mapping and a multivariate (general linear model) approach. Our univariate approach follows methods from "Mapping brain function during naturalistic viewing using high-density diffuse optical tomography" by Fishell et al.. In contrast, the multivariate approach follows "Mapping brain function in adults and young children during naturalistic viewing with high-density diffuse optical tomography" by Tripathy, Fogarty et al.
